# pw-killer
Brute force program written in C.

This program is still under development. For now, it is only able to crack numeric password of zip files. However, it makes use of functions such as `sprintf` and `system`, which are extremely slow. As I become more knowledgeable in C, I will try to make this code more optimal and less resource consuming.
